# Fantastic Animals - JavaScript

This is a website project developed only with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, created as part of my studies in the JavaScript Complete ES6 course by Origamid.
The main goal was to practice modern JavaScript concepts, organize code using modules, integrate with APIs, and add dynamic effects to the interface.

During development, I also built a fully functional slider using only JavaScript, without external libraries, to improve my programming logic and DOM manipulation skills.

## Technologies Used

- HTML

Structure of the page content, including sections, lists, links, and images.

-CSS

Styling the interface with colors, fonts, spacing, responsiveness, and animations.

-JavaScript

DOM manipulation to add interactivity.

Fetching data from APIs.

Code modularization with import and export.

Creating animations, effects, and the custom slider.

-ESLint

Tool to standardize code style, fix indentation, avoid typos, and follow best development practices.

## Main dependencies

live-server — to run the project locally and reload the page on every change.

eslint — to keep the code standardized and free of common errors.

## About the course
